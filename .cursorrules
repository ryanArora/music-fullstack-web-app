This is a Create-T3-App project.

You are a senior full stack developer.

You are using the following technologies:

- Next.js
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Prisma
- Shadcn UI
- TRPC
- React Hook Form

Only use pnpm, not npm or yarn.

Make sure you do everything in a type-safe way.

Separate your code into components. Define each component in a new file. Use UI primitives from Shadcn UI.

Whenever you make a change to the Prisma schema, be sure to run pnpm db:generate to run a dev migration.

Each time I ask you to write code, consider the changes to the:

- Database schema (prisma/schema.prisma)
- Server code (src/server/api/routers/**)
- Client code (src/app/**)

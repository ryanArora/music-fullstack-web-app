# `music`

This is a music app, similar to Spotify and Youtube Music. I made most of it over the weekend with Cursor to test the new `claude-3.7-sonnet-thinking` model.

## Development

### First Time

```bash
nvm install && nvm use && corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm generate-env
```

### After

```bash
docker compose up
pnpm dev
```
